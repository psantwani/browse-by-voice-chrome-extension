# Project Description

'Browse by Voice' is an end-to-end speech based browsing application that captures user commands from your computer based audio input or your android device. You can check emails, open websites, navigate through them, use search engines, play videos, open images, automatically login to your social media and email accounts, all without using your keyboard or mouse. And this is not it. You can even connect your computer to your android device wirelessly and send voice commands via our android app.
